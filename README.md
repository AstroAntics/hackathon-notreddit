# What is notreddit?
```notreddit``` is MarCODE's first Hackathon project for the week of November 17 - 21, 2022.

# How do I get started?
* Download the repo or do a ```git clone```.
* Run ```npm install``` and ```npm start```.
* Go to ```localhost:3000```. If you see ```"Hello, world!"``` then everything has worked out fine.

# Problems?
* Too bad.
